# The Formula 1 Quiz

The Formula 1 Quiz is a novelty quiz created for F1 fans around the globe. The quiz has two levels of diffculty based on quiz type. '2022 Wrapped' is an easy level testing the user knowledge of the latest F1 season. 'Driver Trivia' is the hard level quiz which tests the users knowledge of F1 drivers outside racing. The quiz uses F1 terminology in the socoring system to mimic the race track environment, the quiz uses term 'time penalty' in place of incorrect answers and the term 'lap time' to record how quick the user completes the quiz.  

This quiz was built as my Portfolio 2 project following completion of the Code Institute Javascript module. 

The completed project can be viewed here:

- [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/): This was used to check the responsiveness of each page of the site on different device sizes including mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop. 

### Device Testing
The website was manually tested on the following devices with no issues:
- Samsung Galaxy S10+
- MacBook Pro 13"
- Dell 27" Desktop Monitor (P2722H)

### Browser Testing
The website was tested on the following browsers with no issues:

- The laptime clock starts once the relevant quiz is loaded.
- When an answer option is clicked the text changes to red. If another answer is clicked, the first answer goes back to grey and the new answer is highlighted in red.
- When the 'submit' button is clicked the answer is checked. If the answer is correct the 'score' is increased, if the answer is incorrect the 'time penalty' is increased.
- When the 'next' button is clicked the next question of the quiz loads. 
- When the last question of the quiz is answered the user is brought to the results page.
