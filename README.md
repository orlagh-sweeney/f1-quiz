# The Formula 1 Quiz

<image src="assets/readme-files/f1quiz-readme-image.png" height="600px">

The Formula 1 Quiz is a novelty quiz created for F1 fans around the globe. The quiz has two levels of diffculty based on quiz type. '2022 Wrapped' is an easy level testing the user knowledge of the latest F1 season. 'Driver Trivia' is the hard level quiz which tests the users knowledge of F1 drivers outside of the race track. 

The quiz uses F1 terminology in a playful way to mimic the race track environment, it uses term 'time penalty' in place of incorrect answers and the term 'lap time' to record how quick the user completes the quiz. For a wrong question answered, the user receives a 10 second time penalty which is added onto their laptime.  

This quiz was built as my Portfolio 2 project following completion of the Code Institute Javascript module. The quiz uses CSS, HTML and Javascript. 

The completed project can be viewed here: https://orlagh-sweeney.github.io/f1-quiz/

    - The first area of the quiz explains how to answer and submit questions and also explains the scoring system. 
- As a user, I want to be able to choose a level of difficulty.
    - The quiz allows me to choose from two levels of difficulty.
- As a user, I want to be able to keep track of my progress during the quiz.
    - The quiz has a live score section so I can keep track of my answer success and time. 
- As a user, I want to be able to quit the game.
     - The quiz has a quit button so I can end the game.

- Lighthouse Report:<br>
<image src="assets/readme-files/f1quiz-lighthouse-report.png" width="700px"></image>

### Tools Testing
The following tools were used to test the website:
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/): This was used throughout the project to test responsiveness, to de-bug any issues, and to test changes to HTML and CSS before implementing them in Gitpod. 
- [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/): This was used to check the responsiveness of each page of the site on different device sizes including mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop. 

### Device Testing
The website was manually tested on the following devices with no issues:
- Samsung Galaxy S10+
- MacBook Pro 13"
- Samsung 27" Desktop Monitor (s27a600uuu)

### Browser Testing
The website was tested on the following browsers with no issues:
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

### Feature Testing
The following features were manually tested:
- Clicking on '2022 Wrapped' or 'Driver Trivia' buttons will bring the user to the quiz page and load the correct questions.
- Clicking on the 'quit' button will bring the user back to the initial quiz page and reset the quiz. 
- The laptime clock starts once the relevant quiz is loaded.
- When an answer option is clicked the text changes to red. If another answer is clicked, the first answer goes back to grey and the new answer is highlighted in red.
- When the 'submit' button is clicked the answer is checked. If the answer is correct the 'Score' is increased, if the answer is incorrect the 'Time Penalty' is increased.
- If the answer is incorrect, 10 seconds are automatically added onto the 'Lap Time'. 
- When the 'next' button is clicked the next question of the quiz loads. 
- When the last question of the quiz is answered the user is brought to the results page. 
- Once the last question is answered, all scoring parameters are reset should the user wish to try the quiz again. 

### Bugs
- The submit button was able to be clicked more than once, this meant that if the user double clicked the button their score would increment by two. To fix this issue, I used the disable property on the submit button. Now, when the user clicks 'submit' the submit button is disabled, then when the user clicks on 'next' the submit button is enabled once again for the next question. 
- The Lap Time timer had a glitch when the seconds were increasing from 09 to 10. A zero was appearing infront of the number 10 (Ex: 010) causing the score area to momentarily shift to the left which would have been noticeable for the user. I fixed this issue by updating the returnData function from > 10 to > 9. This fixed the bug and improved user experience. 
- There was a significant gap at the bottom of the div that holds the quiz on both mobile and tablet devices. To fix this I changed the height of the container div to 'fit-content' so that the design was responsive for these devices.
- The favicon icon was not working on the deployed site. I changed the file path structure in the head to fix this. 

## Finished Product
- The live link to the completed product can be found here: https://orlagh-sweeney.github.io/f1-quiz/

## Deployment
The website was developed in Gitpod. It was then commited and pushed to GitHub. 
The finished site was then deployed to GitHub pages using the following steps: 
1. Open GitHub and click on the f1-quiz repository. 
2. Once inside the repository, locate and click on the Settings tab. 
3. On the left handside, under the 'Code and automation' section, click on Pages. 
4. In the Branch section, locate the dropdown menu and change it from None to Main. 
5. Click save. The page will refresh with a link to the website.

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) were used throughout the development to educate myself and to seek help and clarification features. 
- In particular I used the following resources in my project: 
    - I used W3Schools to create a fixed footer. I used the solution on the [Fixed Footer](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_footer.asp) page. 
    - I used code from CodeExpainedRepo to create the functions to call Quiz A or Quiz B questions: [CodeExplainedRepo](https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Multiple-Choice-Quiz-JavaScript/blob/master/quiz.js).   
    - I used code from an article by Walter Nacimento on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) to create the quiz timer: [Creating a timer with javascript](https://dev.to/walternascimentobarroso/creating-a-timer-with-javascript-8b7).
    - I used a solution by Max Lemieux on Stackoverflow to add the 10 second time penalty for wrong aswers: [Max Lemieux answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60370583).
